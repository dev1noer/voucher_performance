## North Star Metrics and Dimensions
### **North Star Metrics:**
- **Total Turnover:** Measures the total revenue generated from transactions with vouchers.
- **Total Discount Given:** Tracks the total discount applied to transactions to assess cost efficiency.
- **Margin After Discount:** Determines the profitability after applying vouchers.
- **Voucher Usage Rate:** Percentage of transactions where vouchers were applied.
- **Average Discount Per Transaction:** Assesses how discounts affect overall profitability.

### **Key Dimensions:**
- **Store Name:** Identifies where vouchers are being used most.
- **Voucher Code:** Helps analyze the performance of specific vouchers.
- **Transaction Date:** Helps track trends over time.
- **Product Category:** Evaluates which categories benefit most from voucher usage.
- **Customer Segments:** Identifies how different customer groups utilize vouchers.

## Summary Insights
1. **High Revenue but Costly Discounts**
   - The total turnover is **656M**, but the total discount applied is **37M**, impacting net profit.
   - Some vouchers (e.g., **DECAHERBALIFE3**) drive significant revenue while maintaining good margin.
   
2. **Negative Margins in Some Vouchers**
   - Certain vouchers (e.g., **DISKON PEMILU**) resulted in a net loss (-74K margin), indicating potential inefficiencies.
   
3. **Top Performing Vouchers**
   - The most effective vouchers contribute to **high turnover with a reasonable margin**.
   - **High-usage vouchers should be optimized rather than over-discounted.**
   
4. **Voucher Effectiveness Varies by Store**
   - Some stores benefit more from vouchers than others, indicating a need for store-specific strategies.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
### **Optimization Strategy:**
- **Analyze Underperforming Vouchers:** Identify vouchers that consistently lead to negative margins and refine their discount structure.
- **Adjust Voucher Distribution by Store:** Stores with lower impact should receive customized voucher campaigns.
- **Introduce Tiered Discounting:** Offer different discounts based on purchase value to maximize revenue while keeping discounts controlled.

### **Further Analysis Areas:**
- **Customer Segmentation:** Which customer groups use vouchers the most, and what is their lifetime value?
- **Product Impact:** Which products benefit the most from vouchers?
- **Seasonality Analysis:** Do vouchers perform better during specific seasons or campaigns?
- **Competitor Benchmarking:** Compare discount strategies with industry benchmarks to stay competitive.

By refining voucher strategies, we can drive sustainable revenue growth while maintaining profitability. ðŸš€
